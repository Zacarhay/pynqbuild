PYNQ has been widely used for machine learning research and prototyping.

FINN, an experimental framework from Xilinx Research Labs to explore deep neural network inference on FPGAs. It specifically targets quantized neural networks, with emphasis on generating dataflow-style architectures customized for each network. 

FINN makes extensive use of PYNQ as a prototyping platform.
