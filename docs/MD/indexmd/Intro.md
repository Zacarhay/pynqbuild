PYNQ is an open-source project from XilinxÂ® that makes it easier to use Xilinx platforms.        

Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of programmable logic and microprocessors to build more capable and exciting electronic systems.

PYNQ can be used with Zynq, Zynq UltraScale+, Zynq RFSoC, Alveo accelerator boards and AWS-F1 to create high performance applications with:

- parallel hardware execution
- high frame-rate video processing
- hardware accelerated algorithms
- real-time signal processing
- high bandwidth IO
- low latency control
