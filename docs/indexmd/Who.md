PYNQ is intended to be used by a wide range of designers and developers including:

- Software developers who want to take advantage of the capabilities of Xilinx platforms without having to use ASIC-style design tools to design hardware.
- System architects who want an easy software interface and framework for rapid prototyping and development of their Zynq, Alveo and AWS-F1 design.
- Hardware designers who want their designs to be used by the widest possible audience.
